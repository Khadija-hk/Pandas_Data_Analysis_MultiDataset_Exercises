# Data Diving with Pandas: A Triathlon of Dataset Challenges!

Welcome to Data Diving with Pandas! 🐼💻🏊‍♂️

## Overview
In this repository, you will find a collection of exercises designed to test your data analysis skills using the Pandas library in Python. Each exercise presents a unique dataset challenge, guiding you through different aspects of data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis. 

## Dataset Challenges
1. **Video Games analysis:** Dive into a dataset containing name, release date, platform, genre, and various other records of video games. Cleanse the data and calculate key performance metrics.

2. **Fifa players analysis:** Kick your way through a dataset of Fifa players! 

3. **Brazilian Forest Fires:** Explore a dataset containing the year, state, and number of forest fires that occurred across Brazil.

## Tools and Technologies
- Pandas: Pandas is an open-source Python library for data science and data analysis. It provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
